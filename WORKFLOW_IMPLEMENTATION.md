# New User Workflow Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a smoother, more customer-friendly workflow that guides users through 3 steps after sign-in:

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Job Search Form Page (`/job-search`)
- **Purpose**: Collects user job preferences and search criteria
- **Features**:
  - Job title/keywords input
  - Location preferences
  - Experience level selection
  - Employment type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship)
  - Remote work preference
  - Date posted filters
  - Beautiful gradient UI with large, easy-to-use form elements

### 2. Job Listings Page (`/job-listings`)
- **Purpose**: Displays relevant job opportunities based on search criteria
- **Features**:
  - Shows search results in card format
  - Multiple job selection with checkboxes
  - Job details including salary, location, company
  - Visual feedback for selected jobs
  - "Proceed to Dashboard" button with selection count
  - Back navigation to refine search

### 3. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Purpose**: Main user workspace with selected jobs and application management
- **Features**:
  - Welcome banner for new workflow users
  - Selected jobs automatically loaded and displayed
  - All existing dashboard functionality preserved
  - "Find More Jobs" button to return to job search

## Updated Authentication Flow

All authentication endpoints now redirect to `/job-search` instead of `/dashboard`:
- Login (`/login`) → `/job-search`
- Register (`/register`) → `/job-search`
- Phone Verification (`/verify-phone`) → `/job-search`

## Technical Implementation

### New Components Created:
1. **JobSearchPage** (`/src/components/pages/JobSearchPage.tsx`)
   - Responsive form with validation
   - Stores search criteria in localStorage
   - Navigates to job listings on submit

2. **JobListingsPage** (`/src/components/pages/JobListingsPage.tsx`)
   - Fetches and displays job listings
   - Handles job selection and navigation
   - Integrates with existing job data structures

### Enhanced Features:
- **AI Interview Integration**: Enhanced with Tavus API for realistic mock interviews
- **Resume Optimization**: Improved AI-powered resume customization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **CORS Support**: Full CORS configuration for production deployment

## Integration Notes

This workflow integrates seamlessly with existing features while providing a more intuitive user experience. All existing dashboard functionality is preserved, and users can switch between the new workflow and direct dashboard access as needed.
